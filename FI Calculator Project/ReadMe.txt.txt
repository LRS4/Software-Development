A project I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to forecast how many years it will take to reach x25 your annual expenses, and to show you your savings rate.

I learnt auto-calculating fields on key-up, HTML DOM, variables, functions, while loops and arithmetic operators. Also, remembering place variables in order of use and know when actions are firing i.e. on button click. Increased understanding in applying algorithms and equations to problems.
