Hash Tables:

A hash table is nothing but an array of linked lists - using a hash (key) function.

Linked Lists:

The elements of the list are linked using pointers.

Pointers: 

Pointer declarations:   int *p; or int* p;   Read: p is a pointer to an int.

De-referencing:   	x = *p;   Read: Assign to x the value pointed to by p.

Address-of operator:   	p = &x;   Read: Assign to p (a pointer) the address of x.
